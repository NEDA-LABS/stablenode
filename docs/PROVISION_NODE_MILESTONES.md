2. **Set up development environment** (Python/Node.js, Docker, database)
3. **Clone/create project repository**
4. **Start with Milestone 1** - Project Setup & Core Infrastructure
5. **Follow milestones sequentially** - Each builds on the previous
6. **Test frequently** - Don't wait until the end to test
7. **Document as you go** - Write docs while building features
8. **Ask for help** - Reach out if stuck on any milestone

Good luck with your provision node development! 🚀
