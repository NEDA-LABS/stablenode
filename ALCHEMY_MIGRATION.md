# Alchemy Migration Milestones

## Overview
Migration from Thirdweb Engine to Alchemy for EVM-only account abstraction and smart contract interactions.

## Phase 1: Setup & Configuration
- [x] Create Alchemy configuration structure
- [x] Add Alchemy credentials to environment variables
- [x] Set up basic HTTP client for Alchemy APIs

## Phase 2: Core Smart Account Features
- [x] Implement smart account creation (equivalent to `CreateServerWallet`)
- [x] Add transaction batch sending functionality
- [x] Implement transaction status checking and monitoring
- [x] Add gas estimation and fee management

## Phase 3: Event & Webhook Management
- [ ] Research Alchemy Notify API capabilities
- [x] Implement event listening for contract interactions
- [ ] Set up Alchemy Notify webhooks for address activity monitoring
- [ ] Migrate webhook management from Thirdweb to Alchemy
- [ ] Update webhook callback handling for Alchemy format

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [x] Create test suite for Alchemy service
- [x] Test service initialization and configuration loading
- [x] Test API connectivity and health checks
- [x] Test service manager and provider switching
- [x] Test deterministic smart account address generation
- [x] Test smart account creation on testnet (Base Sepolia deployed!)
- [ ] Test transaction sending and status monitoring
- [x] Test receive address creation via Alchemy (✅ Working - unique addresses generated)
- [ ] Test payment detection without webhooks (polling mechanism needed)
- [ ] Validate gas sponsorship functionality (if using Gas Manager)
- [ ] Performance comparison with Thirdweb

## Phase 5: Integration & Migration
- [x] Update main.go to use Alchemy service conditionally
- [x] Add feature flag for switching between services
- [x] Migrate receive address service to support Alchemy
- [x] Add hybrid migration option (USE_ALCHEMY_FOR_RECEIVE_ADDRESSES)
- [x] Skip Thirdweb webhook creation when using Alchemy receive addresses
- [x] Add protocol_fee field to payment order schema (database constraint fix)
- [ ] Implement payment detection mechanism (Alchemy webhooks or polling)
- [ ] Deploy operational smart accounts on other chains (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)
- [ ] Update database references and configurations (if needed)

## Phase 6: Cleanup & Documentation
- [x] Remove Tron-specific code from existing services
- [x] Update documentation (readme.md, README.md)
- [x] Add development setup guide for Alchemy
- [x] Document migration paths and cost comparison
- [ ] Clean up unused Thirdweb dependencies (after full migration)
- [ ] Remove Thirdweb service (after successful migration and verification)

## Environment Variables Needed
```bash
# Alchemy Configuration
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key
ALCHEMY_BASE_URL=https://api.g.alchemy.com/v2
ALCHEMY_GAS_POLICY_ID=your_gas_policy_id  # Optional for gas sponsorship

# Feature Flags
USE_ALCHEMY_SERVICE=false  # Set to true when ready to switch
```

## Success Criteria
- [x] All smart account operations implemented in Alchemy service
- [x] Service manager provides unified interface
- [x] Feature flag enables safe switching between providers
- [x] All unit tests passing
- [x] Configuration loading working correctly
- [x] All EVM chains supported (Tron references removed)
- [ ] Transaction success rate >= 99% (pending testnet validation)
- [ ] Response times <= current Thirdweb performance (pending benchmarking)
- [ ] Gas costs optimized or equivalent (pending production testing)
- [ ] Webhook functionality maintained or improved (pending implementation)

## Rollback Plan
- Keep Thirdweb service intact during testing
- Use feature flag to switch between services
- Monitor error rates and performance metrics
- Quick rollback capability if issues arise

- **Chain**: Base Sepolia (84532)
- **Owner**: `0xFb84E5503bD20526f2579193411Dd0993d080775`
- **Factory**: Light Account v2.0.0 (`0x0000000000400CdFef5E2714E63d8040b700BC24`)
- **Explorer**: https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x8493c7FF99dedD3da3eaCDC56ff474c12Ac3e67D

## Test Results Summary
All core tests passing (100% success rate):

| Test | Status | Duration | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| `TestAlchemyServiceCreation` | ✅ PASS | 0.00s | Service initialization working |
| `TestAlchemyServiceHealthCheck` | ✅ PASS | 1.12s | API connectivity verified |
| `TestServiceManager` | ✅ PASS | 0.00s | Provider switching functional |
| `TestSmartAccountAddressGeneration` | ✅ PASS | 0.00s | Deterministic address generation |
| **Deployment Test** | ✅ PASS | 3.9s | Smart account deployed on Base Sepolia |

**Total Tests**: 5/5 passing  
**Code Coverage**: Core functionality covered  
**Integration Status**: Ready for production testing

## Implementation Progress
**Completed**: Phases 1, 2, 4 (partial), 5 (partial)  
**In Progress**: Phase 3 (webhooks), Phase 5 (payment detection)  
**Pending**: Phase 4 (transaction testing), Phase 6 (cleanup)

## Current Blockers
⚠️ **Payment Detection**: Orders can be created with Alchemy receive addresses, but payment detection requires either:
- **Option A**: Alchemy Notify webhooks (recommended)
- **Option B**: Polling mechanism to check address balances
- **Option C**: Use existing blockchain indexer tasks

**Impact**: Without payment detection, orders will not be automatically fulfilled even after user deposits crypto.

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### **Immediate (Critical - Phase 3)**
1. **Implement Payment Detection** - Choose and implement one of:
   - Alchemy Notify webhooks for address activity
   - Polling mechanism to check receive address balances
   - Extend existing blockchain indexer to monitor Alchemy addresses
2. **Test Payment Flow** - Create order → Deposit crypto → Verify detection → Check fulfillment

### **Short-term (Phase 4 & 5 Completion)**
3. ✅ ~~Testnet Deployment~~ - Smart account deployed on Base Sepolia
4. ✅ ~~Test Receive Address Creation~~ - Working with unique address generation
5. **Test Transaction Sending** - Send test transactions from deployed smart account
6. **Monitor Transaction Status** - Verify status checking works correctly
7. **Production Testing** - Enable on testnet with real order flow
8. **Multi-chain Deployment** - Deploy smart account on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum (optional)
9. **Cost Analysis** - Measure actual cost savings vs Thirdweb

### **Long-term (Phase 6)**
10. **Gas Manager Setup** - Configure gas sponsorship policies (optional)
11. **Production Rollout** - Gradual migration with monitoring
12. **Cleanup** - Remove Thirdweb dependencies after successful migration
