# Smart Account Address Computed ✅

## Your Smart Account Details

### **Computed Address**
```
0x8493c7FF99dedD3da3eaCDC56ff474c12Ac3e67D
```

### **Configuration**
- **Factory**: `0x0000000000400CdFef5E2714E63d8040b700BC24` (Alchemy Light Account v2.0.0)
- **Implementation**: `0x8E8e658E22B12ada97B402fF0b044D6A325013C7`
- **Owner Address**: `0xFb84E5503bD20526f2579193411Dd0993d080775`
- **Chain**: Base Sepolia (84532)
- **Salt**: 0 (first account)

### **Verification**
✅ Address computation is **deterministic** and working correctly

## Next Steps

### **Step 1: Check if Account Exists**
Visit Base Sepolia explorer to see if the account is already deployed:
```
https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x8493c7FF99dedD3da3eaCDC56ff474c12Ac3e67D
```

**What to look for:**
- If the page shows "Contract" - Account is already deployed ✅
- If the page shows "Address" with no code - Account needs deployment ⏳

### **Step 2: Get Testnet ETH**
Your **owner wallet** needs Base Sepolia ETH to deploy the account:

**Owner Address**: `0xFb84E5503bD20526f2579193411Dd0993d080775`

**Get testnet ETH from:**
- Alchemy Faucet: https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/base-sepolia
- Or bridge from Sepolia: https://bridge.base.org/

### **Step 3: Deploy the Account**
Two deployment options:

#### **Option A: Deploy via First Transaction (Recommended)**
- The account will be automatically deployed when you send the first UserOperation
- More gas efficient
- Uses the `initCode` in the UserOp

#### **Option B: Direct Factory Call**
- Call the factory's `createAccount(owner, salt)` function directly
- Account is deployed immediately
- Useful for pre-funding before use

## Testing Commands

### **Compute Address Again**
```bash
go test ./services -v -run TestComputeSmartAccountAddressWithRealOwner
```

### **Test Full Creation Flow**
```bash
go test ./services -v -run TestCreateSmartAccountFlow
```

## Important Notes

1. **Deterministic Address**: This address will ALWAYS be the same for:
   - Same owner address
   - Same factory
   - Same salt (0)

2. **Cross-Chain**: The same owner will have DIFFERENT smart account addresses on different chains

3. **Multiple Accounts**: To create a second account for the same owner, use salt=1, salt=2, etc.

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Address computed successfully
- [x] Address is deterministic (same inputs = same output)
- [x] Different owners produce different addresses
- [ ] Owner wallet has Base Sepolia ETH
- [ ] Account deployed on Base Sepolia
- [ ] Account verified on explorer
- [ ] Test transaction sent

## What's Next?

Once you have testnet ETH in your owner wallet, we can:
1. Deploy the smart account
2. Send a test transaction
3. Verify everything works on-chain

**Status**: Step 1 Complete ✅
